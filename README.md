# Next_word_prediction_NLP
Predict the next word in a sentence using an LSTM neural network trained on text data

This project implements a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras to predict the next word in a sequence. The model uses:

Embedding Layer for word representation

LSTM Layer for sequence learning

Softmax Output for word probability prediction
